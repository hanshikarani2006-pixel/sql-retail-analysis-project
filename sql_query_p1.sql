 -- Q.1 Write a SQL query to retrieve all columns for sales made on '2022-11-05

SELECT *
FROM retail_sales
WHERE sale_date = '2022-11-05';


-- Q.2 Write a SQL query to retrieve all transactions where the category is 'Clothing' and the quantity sold is more than 4 in the month of Nov-2022

SELECT*FROM retail_sales 
where 
   sale_date >= '2022-11-01'
 AND sale_date < '2022-12-01'
 AND
quantiy >= 4 AND  category = 'Clothing';


-- Q.3 Write a SQL query to calculate the total sales (total_sale) for each category.

SELECT 
    category,
    SUM(total_sale) as net_sale,
    COUNT(*) as total_orders
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY 1;

-- Q.4 Write a SQL query to find the average age of customers who purchased items from the 'Beauty' category.

SELECT
    ROUND(AVG(age), 2) as avg_age
FROM retail_sales
WHERE category = 'Beauty';


-- Q.5 Write a SQL query to find all transactions where the total_sale is greater than 1000.

SELECT * FROM retail_sales
WHERE total_sale > 1000;


-- Q.6 Write a SQL query to find the total number of transactions (transaction_id) made by each gender in each category.

SELECT 
    category,
    gender,
    COUNT(*) as total_trans
FROM retail_sales
GROUP 
    BY 
    category,
    gender
ORDER BY 1;



-- Q.7 Write a SQL query to find the top 5 customers based on the highest total sales 

SELECT 
    customer_id,
    SUM(total_sale) as total_sales
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- Q.8 Write a SQL query to find the number of unique customers who purchased items from each category.


SELECT 
    category,    
    COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) as cnt_unique_cs
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY category
